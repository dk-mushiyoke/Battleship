# Battleship
A simple battleship game written in C with unix pipe and cursor library.

This project uses piping to communicate on two threads and draws out gameboard using unix curse library

** Note that I was only able to get the curses compile on Linux. No luck on Mac OS X.

Compile with ./make and run the game with ./battleship

You need to run the game twice, preferrably in two terminals in order to proceed the game.

Have fun bombarding!
